<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite impossible to
over-estimate the deep importance of this great subject, for on
our conclusions respecting it must depend our confidence in all
the great mysteries of the Gospel.&nbsp; There is a sphere within
which the human mind is capable of astonishing achievement, and I
would be the last to undervalue human intellect.&nbsp; It has
done vast things already, and is doing great things now.&nbsp;
But there is a limit beyond which it has no power to pass; <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>a world in
which it has no means of investigation; an unseen kingdom which
lies quite outside its range.&nbsp; Yet, though unseen, this
kingdom is all important; and, though an undiscovered country, it
is one in which we are all most deeply concerned, for we are all
rapidly hastening thither, and He who is our Father, our Creator,
our Redeemer, our Lord, our life, is the great and unseen Head of
it.&nbsp; Thus, no science can ever inform us as to the nature of
the Godhead, the plan of salvation, or eternal life; and it is
altogether unphilosophical and unscientific to attempt to reduce
such subjects to the ordinary rules of science and
philosophy.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s plan of salvation can only be known
from God Himself; so that, if He has not imparted to us all
needful knowledge respecting it, there is no human power that can
ever supply the deficiency, and we must <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>live and die convinced of the
soul&rsquo;s immortality, but still in utter ignorance of the
plan which God has arranged for its safety.&nbsp; Hence the
inexpressible value of the inspired word of Scripture.&nbsp; It
is the communication from God to man respecting the deep things
of the unseen world.&nbsp; It supplies that which lies beyond the
reach of human investigation, and gives us exactly that
information which dying man requires.&nbsp; It unfolds to us the
eternal nature of God, and the plan of salvation which He has
prepared in tender mercy for a fallen world.&nbsp; If therefore
our Bible fail us, our whole hope fails with it, and if we cannot
rely on its sacred statements, we are left without any
trustworthy information as to all those great truths which most
deeply concern us.&nbsp; If we cannot rely on Scripture as a
communication from God we have nothing to take its place; and all
our <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>present
joy, as well as our future hopes, must melt away into utter
ignorance respecting all that lies beyond the range of science,
and utter hopelessness as to all beyond this present world.</p>
<p>It is not my present object to attempt to prove the
inspiration of Scripture.&nbsp; It is a great and noble subject,
and one which I should rejoice to investigate.&nbsp; But it is
not the subject of this paper.&nbsp; My object is to examine the
extent and nature of inspiration, and to that I must exclusively
confine myself.&nbsp; I take it for granted therefore that
inspiration is an admitted fact, so that my only business is to
consider how far it carries us, and what security it gives us for
certain, reliable, infallible truth, in all the statements of the
inspired word.</p>
<p>It has been said that &lsquo;Inspiration is that idea of
Scripture which we gather from the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>knowledge of it,&rsquo; <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> and an attempt has been made to show
how by such a definition all difficulties are overcome.&nbsp; I
freely grant that such a theory does present a very easy and
ready method of getting rid of difficulty, for, if we decide on
reducing the authority of Scripture to our own ideas respecting
it, it is not likely that there will be much left to embarrass
us.&nbsp; There is however one difficulty, and that a most
important one, which it cannot solve.&nbsp; It can give no solid
foundation for the anxious soul to rest on, and must leave us
floating into eternity with no better support than a vague idea
of our own creation.</p>
<p>St. Peter differs very widely from the author of that essay;
for though the author boldly asserts that <a
name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> &lsquo;for any of the higher or
supernatural views of inspiration there is no foundation in the
Gospels or Epistles,&rsquo; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>St. Peter broadly and plainly asserts
that &lsquo;Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.&rsquo; (2 Pet. i. 21.)&nbsp; Here then we have the
Apostolic definition of the work of inspiration, and by that
definition we are taught that there are two distinct elements to
be considered, the divine and the human; the divine, for the Holy
Ghost moved the writers; and the human, for the communication did
not come as a direct voice from heaven, but holy men spake as
they were moved.</p>
<p>In order therefore fully to investigate the subject, it will
be necessary to examine (1) the divine element, (2) the human
element, and (3) the combination of the two; after which we may
consider some of the difficulties which have been thought to lie
against the doctrine.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>THE
DIVINE ELEMENT.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">need</span> scarcely say that this
divine element is the great subject of modern controversy.&nbsp;
But I hope we may meet the points more especially agitated, by
considering four questions.</p>
<p class="gutindent">I.&nbsp; Does it extend over the whole
book?</p>
<p class="gutindent">II.&nbsp; Is it equal?</p>
<p class="gutindent">III.&nbsp; Is it verbal?</p>
<p class="gutindent">IV.&nbsp; Does it render the word
infallible?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Does it extend over the whole book?</p>
<p>Our first inquiry, then, must relate to the area covered by
it; or, in other words, to the question, Is the whole
inspired?&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Were all the writers of Scripture thus moved by the Holy
Ghost? or merely some of them, and those in certain books
only?</p>
<p>Now, taking the language of St. Paul in 2 Tim. iii. 16, as our
guide, we have a clear and decisive answer; for it is here
written, &lsquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is stated by Dr. Lee <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> that the word &lsquo;Scripture&rsquo;
occurs either in the singular or plural no less than fifty times,
and in every single instance it is employed solely with reference
to that collection of writings which were regarded as the oracles
of God.&nbsp; Everything therefore included in that collection is
here declared to be
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
or given by inspiration.</p>
<p>The only possible question therefore is, How much was
included?</p>
<p>Now, whatever men may think of the doctrine of inspiration,
all must admit as <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>an historical fact, that when St. Paul wrote these words,
the whole of the Old Testament was included in the Jewish
canon.&nbsp; The Jews, notwithstanding all their faults, were
admirable guardians of Scripture, and there was no doubt in the
mind of any pious Jew as to what books together formed his
Bible.&nbsp; He was much clearer on that subject than many of our
modern writers.&nbsp; When therefore St. Paul spoke of &lsquo;All
Scripture,&rsquo; there is no doubt in the world that he included
in his statement every line and letter of the Old Testament, and
he taught us in those words that the whole, from first to last,
from the first of Genesis to the last of Malachi was given by
inspiration of God.</p>
<p>In saying this, I make no exception whatever with reference to
the historical books.&nbsp; I think it has been clearly shown
that those historical writings which are not <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in the
Pentateuch are included in that part of Scripture called the
Prophets.&nbsp; In which case the language of St. Peter, already
quoted, refers to history as well as prediction.&nbsp; Nay,
more!&nbsp; I do not hesitate to say, that if I were called upon
to prove inspiration, there is no portion of the whole volume on
which I should be better pleased to meet an opponent than the
historical portions of the Old Testament.&nbsp; So strong is the
argument in their favour, that although by so saying I may
startle some, I am prepared, after the most careful deliberation,
to affirm that I cannot separate them from the word of God
without at the same time abandoning the whole of my
Christianity.&nbsp; My reason for this statement is, that our
Lord Himself in His own teaching has most distinctly sanctioned
them.&nbsp; Men cavil at the strange miracles recorded in them,
but, while men cavil, He refers to no less than <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>nine of these
miracles as facts.&nbsp; The flood, the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah, the death of Lot&rsquo;s wife, the burning bush, the
manna, the brazen serpent, the cure of Naaman, the preservation
of the widow of Sarepta, and the rescue of Jonah, are all
endorsed by His divine authority.&nbsp; To the books of Moses,
which are chiefly historical, He perpetually refers as to the
word of God, describing their testimony as more worthy of credit
than that of men risen from the dead.&nbsp; And as for the
much-despised first chapter of the book of Genesis, the
speculation, as we are now taught, of some ancient Hebrew
Descartes, He actually quotes the 27th verse as descriptive of
the fact of creation.&nbsp; I am brought therefore to the
conclusion that if there is any portion of the whole volume which
may pre-eminently be said to have the broad seal and stamp of our
Lord&rsquo;s authority placed <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>upon it with His own hand, that
portion is the Pentateuch.&nbsp; All, therefore, I am thoroughly
persuaded, must rise and fall together.&nbsp; If we believe in
the Lord Jesus Christ, we must receive the books of Moses as
inspired Scripture; and never can we abandon them till we are
prepared to admit that in His own sacred teaching the Lord
Himself has misled His people, or, in other and plainer words,
till we cease to be believers in Jesus.</p>
<p>But are we to limit this language of St. Paul to the Old
Testament?&nbsp; I think it has been clearly shown that we are
not.&nbsp; For although the canon of the New Testament was not
complete when St. Paul wrote these words, we must remember that
the second Epistle to Timothy was one of the latest epistles, and
that, according to Horne&rsquo;s list, the whole of the New
Testament, or very nearly the whole, except the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>writings of
St. John, were written at or about the time of its
publication.&nbsp; The only question is, whether these writings
were then regarded as Scripture: for, if they were, they were
clearly included in the declaration that all Scripture is given
by inspiration of God.&nbsp; Now, one thing is perfectly clear,
namely, that St. Paul claimed the authority of Scripture for his
own epistles: for after having carefully drawn the distinction
between his private opinions and inspired decisions, he
distinctly says, &lsquo;Yet not I, but the Lord&rsquo; (1 Cor.
vii. 10).&nbsp; It is equally clear that St. Peter classed the
apostles with the prophets, 2 Pet. iii. 2.&nbsp; It is equally
clear again, that the Gospel of St. Luke was already admitted as
Scripture, for in 1 Tim. v. 18, St. Paul quotes two passages, one
from Deuteronomy and one from St. Luke, declaring of both equally
that they were taken from <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Scripture.&nbsp; &lsquo;For the
scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn.&nbsp; And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.&rsquo;
(Deut. xxv. 4; Luke, x. 7.)&nbsp; It is equally clear again, that
St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles were included by St. Peter in the
canon; for he clearly regarded them as Scripture when he wrote
his second epistle.&nbsp; He saw some difficulties in them, but
that did not affect his opinion of their admitted inspiration,
when he said (2 Pet. iii. 15, 16), &lsquo;Even as our beloved
brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given unto him, hath
written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them
of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood,
which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also
the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>New Testament therefore, as well as Old, was included in the
declaration, &lsquo;All scripture <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>is given by inspiration of
God;&rsquo; and the conclusion to which I am irresistibly brought
is, that we have no right to pick and choose amongst the various
portions of the word of God.&nbsp; I believe the whole to be
arranged as a whole for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s great
purpose, that the whole is included in &lsquo;the
Scriptures,&rsquo; and that the parts are so interwoven one with
another, and so beautifully fitted into each other by God&rsquo;s
divine hand, that there will be found ultimately to be no
intermediate path between receiving the whole as the word of God,
or sweeping away the whole, and launching forth on a sea of
scepticism, without a Bible, without a Saviour, and, as the last
step, without a God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; Is it equal?</p>
<p>I need scarcely say that many persons, and some of them most
excellent men, <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>have entertained the idea of a graduated scale of
inspiration, and hence the great importance of the
question.&nbsp; Is it equal throughout?&nbsp; Or is it
variable?</p>
<p>In attempting an answer to this question, it is essential that
we observe the wide distinction between the authorship and the
subject-matter of the book, for, if not, we shall soon get into
confusion.</p>
<p>Now Christian brethren must not be startled by my stating that
in the subject-matter there are the widest possible
distinctions.&nbsp; It appears indeed to consist of three
distinct classes of subjects, or rather three distinct kinds of
matter.</p>
<p>In the first place, there are direct communications,
communicated from heaven without the use of the mind of
man.&nbsp; Of this class are the ten commandments, the words,
&lsquo;This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,&rsquo;
and the discourses of <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>our Lord.&nbsp; Such words were not
given by inspiration, for they did not pass through the medium of
the human mind, but came direct from heaven.&nbsp; In them there
was no inspiration, but communication.</p>
<p>There is a second large class of passages which were given by
inspiration.&nbsp; The human mind was employed as the medium for
conveying God&rsquo;s will and purpose.&nbsp; This was the case
with the prophets, the Psalms, and other similar passages.&nbsp;
Here was inspiration, and the words so uttered were divine words,
though given through the human medium, and not in direct
communication.</p>
<p>But there is a third large class of passages in which there is
neither inspiration nor communication.&nbsp; There are various
sayings and doings of uninspired men, good actions and bad
actions, good words and bad words, interspersed with miracles and
other wonders <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>of God&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Now no one supposes that all
these persons spoke by inspiration, and it is utterly unfair to
quote such passages as inconsistent with the inspiration of
Scripture, for no one asserts that they are inspired.&nbsp; It is
utterly unfair, for example, of Mr. Coleridge to quote the
language of Job&rsquo;s friends, and to attack the inspiration of
the book by the assertion that it is impossible to believe them
to be inspired.&nbsp; Of course it is, for, if we believed them
to be inspired, we should be flying in the face of the inspired
book itself which records the divine communication, &lsquo;Ye
have not spoken of me the thing that is right&rsquo; (Job, xlii.
7.)&nbsp; We do not claim inspiration for those words, but for
the authorship of the book which declares that the speakers spoke
those words, and that in doing so they were wrong.</p>
<p>In the subject-matter then we have three <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>divisions,
direct communications, inspired writings, and the miscellaneous
sayings and doings of uninspired men.&nbsp; But in addition to
this there is the question of authorship, which is clearly
totally distinct from the matter, and it is the inspiration of
the author which makes the book the word of God.&nbsp; Whatever
the matter be if the author is inspired the book becomes inspired
scripture.&nbsp; The sayings of uninspired men may be put on
record by an inspired author, and our Heavenly Father may have
shown just as much mercy in directing His prophets to record the
sins of bad men for our warning, as the actions of His chosen
servants for our guidance and encouragement.&nbsp; Now, so far as
the authorship is concerned, we find no distinction
whatever.&nbsp; All alike is called &lsquo;Scripture;&rsquo; all
&lsquo;the word of God;&rsquo; all is included in the statement,
&lsquo;Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>written for
our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
scripture might have hope;&rsquo; and all is stamped by divine
authority in the words, &lsquo;All scripture is given by
inspiration of God.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; Is it verbal?</p>
<p>I am now approaching a difficult subject, and I should be
sorry to speak rashly.&nbsp; But at the same time, I must not
speak with hesitation, for the more I have studied the subject
the more firmly am I brought to the deliberate and fixed
conviction that the whole book, including words as well as
thoughts, is to be received by the believer as the word of
God.&nbsp; Let me briefly state my reasons.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I can draw no other conclusion from the title given
to it, viz. &lsquo;The word of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I find it
especially mentioned as God&rsquo;s <i>word</i>; when I meet with
such a <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>passage as &lsquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but
by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,&rsquo; I
find it hard to believe that the <i>words</i> are not included in
the act of inspiration, and that the divine inspiration extends
no farther than to the thoughts.&nbsp; If the expression were
&lsquo;the truth of God,&rsquo; or &lsquo;the will of God,&rsquo;
I could understand a reference to His mind without the necessity
of applying inspiration to the language; but I cannot exclude the
idea of inspired words from that book whose title is &lsquo;the
<i>word</i> of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I find certain quotations, the whole value of which
entirely depends on verbal accuracy.&nbsp; In Gal. iii. 16, St.
Paul quotes from Gen. xii. 7, and his whole argument turns on the
distinction between the singular and plural number in one word
contained in the promise made to Abraham: &lsquo;He saith not,
and to seeds, as of many; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>but as of one, And to thy seed, which
is Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; So in Matt. xxii. 32, our Lord quotes the
words spoken to Moses in Exod. iii. 6, and rests his whole
argument on the present tense of the substantive verb: &lsquo;I
<i>am</i> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob.&nbsp; God is not the God of the dead, but of the
living,&rsquo; proving by that present tense that Abraham was at
that time an existing person awaiting the resurrection.&nbsp; It
may perhaps be said that both these instances occur in direct
divine communications; but we must remember that we have to
consider the inspiration of Moses who recorded that
communication, and surely the quotation proves that the
historical inspiration of the author might be trusted for verbal
accuracy.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; There are many passages in which the words are quoted
quite independently <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>of the thoughts of the context.&nbsp; As an
illustration, refer to our Lord&rsquo;s quotation of Isa. lvi.
7.&nbsp; The whole of that passage refers simply to the admission
of the sons of the stranger into the covenant.&nbsp; The emphatic
words of the prophecy are &lsquo;for all people,&rsquo; and the
one idea of the context is the admission of all people to the
covenant.&nbsp; But, in unfolding this truth, the prophet was led
to express the prophecy in the words, &lsquo;My house shall be
called a house of prayer;&rsquo; and this expression our Lord
extracts from the prophecy, and makes it the groundwork of His
stern rebuke when He cleared the temple.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Once more.&nbsp; It seems perfectly clear that the
prophets in many cases did not understand their own
writings.&nbsp; We are sometimes told that we must only
understand the prophecies as the prophets themselves did.&nbsp;
But if we were to act on that <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>rule, it must follow that in many
cases we could not understand them at all; for we know, in fact,
that Daniel had to pray for an understanding of the prophecy just
conveyed through his own lips, and we are distinctly taught by
St. Peter that the prophets inquired and searched diligently into
the meaning of their own prophecies. (1 Pet. i. 11.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of
Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified
beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should
follow.&rsquo;&nbsp; This also I have no doubt is the meaning of
the expression, &lsquo;No prophecy is of any private
interpretation&rsquo; (2 Pet. i. 20),
&#7984;&delta;&#8055;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&pi;&iota;&lambda;&#8059;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;
&omicron;&#8016; &gamma;&#8055;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;,
&lsquo;Has not arisen out of private interpretation,&rsquo; and
is not the result of the writer&rsquo;s own thoughts, &lsquo;but
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, if this were the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>case, the
whole prophecy must depend on verbal accuracy.&nbsp; If they were
employed to speak words which had a certain deep, hidden meaning,
unknown to themselves, and intended by God to remain unknown
until their meaning should be made manifest by fulfilment at the
coming of the Lord, surely we must admit that it was the words
and not the thoughts which God inspired.&nbsp; The thoughts were
actually withheld from the prophets, but they were moved to utter
words which required events then unknown to bring out their true
meaning.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But it may be said that this applies to the
predictive portions of Scripture only, and not to the
historical.&nbsp; It possibly may, and the last argument clearly
does.&nbsp; But have we any thing to lead us to suppose that
there is one kind of inspiration for the predictive, and another
for the historical <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>portions?&nbsp; Are they not all spoken of as one
book?&nbsp; Are not many of these verbal quotations included in
the historical portions, as <i>e.g.</i> the promise made to
Abraham?&nbsp; Unless, therefore, it can be proved to me that
there is such a distinction drawn by divine authority, I feel it
my privilege to regard the whole as one, to receive the whole
with equal reverence, and to accept the whole, prediction, psalm,
history, facts, thoughts, and words, as the inspired Word of the
living God.</p>
<p>But after some measure of careful study, I have been led to
the conviction that the question of verbal inspiration is not the
one really at issue.&nbsp; For no one believes that, if there be
any inaccuracy, it took place in the words only.&nbsp; It must
have taken place in the thoughts, in the matter, in the
facts.&nbsp; If, <i>e.g.</i>, there is a variation between St.
Matthew and St. Luke, no one supposes <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>that they meant to convey the same
thoughts, but made a mistake in accidentally selecting different
words.&nbsp; The real point of the controversy is the infallible
accuracy of the matter.&nbsp; And this leads to my last
question.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Is it infallible?</p>
<p>On the answer to this question must depend our confidence in
Scripture.&nbsp; Some excellent men tell us it is infallible in
so far as divine truth is involved.&nbsp; But I freely confess
that this does not satisfy my own mind.&nbsp; I do not like that
limitation.&nbsp; I am prepared to receive the whole book as
invested with infallible accuracy from God Himself, and in taking
this view of the subject, I feel the great satisfaction of
believing that I am in harmony with the mind of St. Paul, St.
Peter, and our great Head Himself.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>For St.
Paul&rsquo;s mind, I would refer to his words in Acts, xxviii.
25, and Heb. x. 15.&nbsp; In the Acts he is quoting from Isaiah,
and says, &lsquo;Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the
prophet,&rsquo; and in the Hebrews he is quoting from the prophet
Jeremiah; but instead of saying, &lsquo;whereof Jeremiah is a
witness to us,&rsquo; he says, without mentioning Jeremiah,
&lsquo;Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us,&rsquo;
taking the word, as it were, out of the hands of fallible man,
and placing it in those of the infallible Spirit.&nbsp; These
passages place inspiration on an equal footing with direct
communication.&nbsp; But if inspired writings were spoken of as
the actual words of the Holy Ghost just as much as if they had
been direct communications; if inspiration was of such a
character as to render the words the words of the Spirit Himself,
can we believe that those words were capable of error?</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>For St.
Peter&rsquo;s testimony, I would refer to his language in 2 Pet.
i. 19, in the context of which passage he is assuring his hearers
that he had not followed cunningly devised fables.&nbsp; And now
mark the threefold evidence which he produces.&nbsp; First, there
is vision, &lsquo;We were eye-witnesses of his
majesty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Secondly, there is hearing, &lsquo;The
voice from heaven we heard.&rsquo;&nbsp; But lastly, there is an
evidence more clear, more true, more trustworthy, than either the
sight of his own eyes, or the hearing of his own ears.&nbsp; That
evidence is Scripture.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have also a more sure word
of prophecy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the testimony of our Lord Himself, refer to two passages,
the one referring to a nice point in a quotation from the Psalms,
John, x. 35; the other to the whole word in its sanctifying
power, John, xvii. 17.&nbsp; Now what is His language?&nbsp; In
the one, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&lsquo;The scripture cannot be broken.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
the other, &lsquo;Thy word is truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these statements of our blessed Lord, I am content to
leave this portion of our subject.&nbsp; In these words of
Scripture, I believe that God Himself has spoken to man, and
therefore in the midst of all the world&rsquo;s disappointments,
and in all the failures of even the Church of God, we have here
that on which the soul may calmly, peacefully, and fearlessly
repose.&nbsp; And whether we look at history or prediction, at
promises or judgments, at prophecies understood by those who
uttered them, or language veiled in mystery until the divine
purpose is developed in history, we receive the whole as
inviolable truth, for all has the stamp of the Spirit Himself,
and all is given by inspiration of God.&nbsp; We receive it, we
honour it, we submit to it, we acknowledge its divine authority,
and <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>welcome with heartfelt thanksgiving its infallible
promises.&nbsp; Yes, we receive it not merely with the deepest
conviction of our most deliberate judgment: but we welcome it to
our soul with all the deep feelings of a thankful heart, and say
with the inspired Psalmist, &lsquo;Thy word is very pure,
therefore thy servant loveth it.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>THE
HUMAN ELEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> there is a human element in the
book as well as a divine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Holy men spake as they
were moved.&rsquo;&nbsp; We shall take, therefore, a very partial
view of the whole subject if we neglect to consider the action of
the holy men as well as the moving of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; What
then are the plain, obvious facts of the case?&nbsp; Are they not
that the books contain as much evidence of human mind, and human
character as if they were uninspired books?&nbsp; The human
authorship is as prominent and conspicuous as the divine, and any
theory of inspiration which excludes it is, I cannot but think,
opposed to the facts of Scripture.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>1.&nbsp; There is distinctive <i>character</i> in the
different writers.&nbsp; Compare St. Paul and St. John, St. Peter
and St. James, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and you see the most
transparent variety, a variety which renders it impossible to
suppose that they were merely pens, machines, or copyists.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There is the use of <i>natural powers or
gifts</i>.&nbsp; St. Paul was a well-educated, intellectual man,
with great reasoning powers, so he supported truth by
argument.&nbsp; David was a poet, so he breathed out as the sweet
psalmist of Israel the hallowed outpourings of a sanctified
heart.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; There is the use of <i>feeling</i>.&nbsp; All the
emotions of the human heart may be found in Scripture.&nbsp;
There is no deep feeling of which man is capable which is not
expressed there.&nbsp; There is love, sorrow in some of its most
tender and touching forms, depression of spirits, joy, hope,
longing <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>desire, deep contrition, calm faith, and perfect
peace.&nbsp; All these you find, not merely described by the
inspired authors, but forming part and parcel of the inspired
word.&nbsp; They are the very word itself, and are expressed as
naturally as if there were no such thing as inspiration.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; There is the use of <i>memory</i>.&nbsp; Our
Lord&rsquo;s promise to His Apostles in John, xiv. 26, applies
clearly to this point, and shows that the gift of the Holy Ghost,
so far from superseding memory, would quicken it, and give it the
power of recalling with accuracy the words intrusted to it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He shall bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever
I have said unto you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; There was also the use of <i>personal experience</i>,
as, <i>e.g.</i>, when St. John said, &lsquo;The word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory&rsquo; (John,
i. 14); and <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>again, &lsquo;That which we have seen and heard declare
we unto you.&rsquo; (1 John, i. 1, 3)</p>
<p>And lastly, and it is a very deeply interesting point, there
was the diligent <i>use of collected information</i>.&nbsp; See
Luke, i. 1&ndash;3, where Luke does not claim to write original
matter, but to have received it from those who from the beginning
were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word.&nbsp; It was
because he had a perfect understanding from them that he
undertook to write out in order the events of the narrative.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that in the composition of Scripture
there was the free use of the human mind.&nbsp; The Pentateuch is
the word of Moses as well as the word of God, for when our Lord
quotes the fifth commandment in Mark, vii. 10, He introduces it
by the words &lsquo;Moses said;&rsquo; although when He condemns
His hearers for the <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>breach of it, he says, they were &lsquo;making the Word
of God of none effect by their tradition.&rsquo; (Mark, v.
13.)&nbsp; The human element is therefore as plain as the
divine.&nbsp; We have not in our Bible a voice speaking from
heaven in accents so strange to human ears that it could only
serve to amaze and terrify; but we have God&rsquo;s will
presented to us through the medium of human language, human
feeling, human thought, and human inquiry; human in all respects
but one, and that is, as we have already found, that it is free
from human error.</p>
<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>THE
COMBINATION.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">trust</span>, then, that I have shown
clearly the existence of the divine and human elements in
Scripture, but it still remains for us to consider the third
point, namely, <span class="GutSmall">THE COMBINATION OF THE
TWO</span>.</p>
<p>How is the union between the divine and human to be
explained?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Not by supposing that the writers were mere pens, or
machines.&nbsp; This is sometimes termed the mechanical theory,
but it is clearly inconsistent with facts.&nbsp; Pens never
think, argue, remember, weep, or rejoice, and all these things
were done by the writers of Scripture.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>2.&nbsp; Not by supposing them to be mere copyists or
amanuenses employed to write down the words of the Spirit, as
Baruch took down the words of Jeremiah.&nbsp; This may have been
the case when they received direct communication, as when Moses
wrote out the ten commandments at the dictation of God: but it
will not apply to inspiration, as it gives no scope for variety
of character.&nbsp; The one dictating mind would be the only one
to appear on such a theory.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We will not attempt to explain it by constructing any
artificial theories as to the action of the Spirit on the mind of
men.&nbsp; Some have endeavoured to classify the modes in which
they consider the Spirit may have acted, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
supervision, elevation, direction, and suggestion.&nbsp; All this
may be right, and it may be wrong; for we are taught (Heb. i. 1)
not merely that God spake in divers times, but in <i>divers
</i><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span><i>manners</i> unto the fathers by the prophets.&nbsp;
But all such distinctions are unsupported by Scripture, and
therefore we may leave them.</p>
<p>My own belief is, that the safest course for the believer is
to take the word as he finds it, and to attempt no explanation at
all.&nbsp; The fact is, that the question lies in the midst of a
class of subjects which have always baffled man&rsquo;s inquiry,
I mean those relating to the points of contact between the mind
of God and the mind of man.&nbsp; The real point is, how has the
mind of God acted on the mind of man, and how can there be union
in one book between his mind which is infinite and infallible,
and the mind of man which is finite and fallible?&nbsp; That
question I cannot solve.&nbsp; But I cannot there leave the
inquiry; for it appears to me that we have an analogous case of
the deepest possible importance, I mean <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the
corresponding union in the person of our blessed Saviour.</p>
<p>Remember, then, that there are two channels through which God
has manifested His will, viz., the incarnate word, and the
written word; and surely we are justified in expecting that there
will be something of the same character in the two
manifestations.</p>
<p>Now, how is it with the incarnate word?&nbsp; In Him there is
a perfect Godhead and a perfect manhood, so that He becomes the
perfect daysman between God and the sinner.&nbsp; His Deity does
not neutralise His humanity, for, though Himself the Creator, He
was wearied, He wept, He prayed, He trusted, He died; and so He
can be touched with the feelings of those who in this suffering
world are called to weep, to suffer, to pray, and to die
now.&nbsp; But neither, on the other hand, did His humanity
neutralise <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>His Deity, for in the midst of His weakness He could
rise in His omnipotence, and bid the dead arise and the waves be
still.&nbsp; If you ask how it is that the one did not neutralise
the other, I cannot say.&nbsp; All I know is that God so ordered
it, and that He so formed the union that the perfection of the
Godhead did not destroy the manhood, nor the perfection of the
manhood take one jot or one tittle from the attributes of the
Godhead.&nbsp; And if men reply that they cannot understand it, I
can only say that they have no right to expect to do so, for are
we not assured in Scripture, &lsquo;Without controversy, great is
the mystery of godliness, God was manifest in the
flesh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But now, passing from the first manifestation of God&rsquo;s
will to the second, <i>i.e.</i> from the incarnate Word to the
written word, are we to be surprised if we meet with a <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>similar union
and a similar difficulty?&nbsp; If, in short, we find the
self-same combination of the divine and human elements?&nbsp; Can
I wonder if it is presented to us in a form so divine that it is
infallibly true, and yet so human that it is full of the workings
of the human intellect and human heart?&nbsp; No, I wonder not,
and I speculate not.&nbsp; But, as I thank God for an incarnate
Redeemer, who has all the omnipotent and infinite attributes of
God, while at the same time He has so true a manhood that I may
appeal to His sympathy on the ground of His experience of all the
trials of the flesh, so I thank God also that He has given us a
Bible so perfect, so divine, so authoritative, so infallible,
that I may trust it without the shadow of a doubt as the unerring
word of the living God, while at the same time it is so
completely human, and thereby so exactly adapted to the human
heart&rsquo;s requirements, <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>that I can welcome it as a word
spoken for myself, and admire the love of our Heavenly Father who
has been pleased to combine in one book a perfect divinity and a
perfect humanity, the infallible truth of a perfect Godhead
combined by God&rsquo;s mysterious power with the heart-touching
utterance of a true and perfect manhood.</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>DIFFICULTIES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, while we rejoice in the great
doctrine of a complete, plenary, and infallible inspiration, we
should be wanting in Christian candour if we were to ignore the
existence of certain difficulties connected with the
subject.&nbsp; There are difficulties we freely acknowledge, some
of which have been felt, not merely by sceptical, but by devout
and Christian minds; and these difficulties I now propose to
consider.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first of these has been already met.&nbsp; It
arises from the variety of mind and character in the inspired
writers.&nbsp; This is thought to be inconsistent with the divine
inspiration of the whole book by <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>one inspiring Spirit; and it would be
a difficulty if we believed, according to the mechanical theory,
that the writers were merely pens, machines, or copyists.&nbsp;
But on the principle that there is a perfect manhood combined
with a perfect Godhead, instead of remaining a difficulty, it
becomes one of the chief beauties of the book, and is the very
thing that renders it so pre-eminently suited to the wants of the
human heart.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A second difficulty arises from the idea that the
language of Scripture is opposed to modern science.&nbsp; The
principle of this difficulty is contained in the words,
&lsquo;Any true doctrine of inspiration must conform to all
well-ascertained facts of history or of science.&rsquo; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>Now, in the first place, we enter our solemn protest against
the Scripture being <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>regarded as a scientific treatise.&nbsp; Its object was
no more to teach us science than to teach us medicine.&nbsp; It
is therefore utterly unfair to bring its language to the test of
scientific experiments.&nbsp; If the allusions of Scripture to
surrounding nature were not altogether in harmony with the
discoveries of modern science, it would not in the least affect
my own idea of inspiration; for in making use of men to convey
His own divine message, I could not expect anything but that our
Heavenly Father should make use of such language as men
understood at the time the book was written; and it seems utterly
unreasonable to suppose that He should render His revelation
unintelligible to those to whom it was given, by going out of His
way to anticipate discoveries which were about to be made some
thousands of years afterwards.&nbsp; But, though the Scriptures
are not given <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>to teach science, and no one has a right to doubt their
inspiration because he does not find scientific accuracy in their
language, we are still prepared to meet the scientific man on his
own ground, and fearlessly to affirm that there is nothing in
Scripture opposed to the well-ascertained discoveries of
science.</p>
<p>For mark well.&nbsp; There is nothing in a miracle opposed to
the laws of science.&nbsp; Science refers to those laws of nature
which are within reach of our investigation; but if, at any time,
the Creator should displace them, either by the action of higher
laws unknown to us, or by the simple power of His will, science
knows nothing of that displacement.&nbsp; It is the office of
science to investigate existing laws; but science knows nothing
of any interruptions of those laws by the sovereign will of Him
who founded them.&nbsp; Such interruptions lie <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>altogether
beyond its province.&nbsp; All, for example, that science can say
is, that we know of no law which could cause the sun to stand
still on Gibeon.&nbsp; But does Scripture ever assert that it was
done by any law within our knowledge?&nbsp; Is it not represented
as the act of God&rsquo;s omnipotence suspending known
laws?&nbsp; And is not that suspending power altogether beyond
the reach of scientific inquiry?&nbsp; The miracle therefore,
lies beyond the reach of science, and cannot be opposed to
it.</p>
<p>But as for the well-ascertained laws of nature and
well-established scientific facts, we fearlessly assert that
there is nothing in Scripture opposed to them.</p>
<p>Let us consider for a moment the two cases most commonly
quoted as involving contradiction: the description of the sun
standing still on Gibeon, and the Mosaic account of the
creation.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>With
reference to the former there are two objections urged.&nbsp; The
first is that of the infidel who denies the possibility of the
miracle, but with that I have nothing to do, as I have already
shown that miracles are not within the range of science.&nbsp;
The second is founded on the language of the narrative, which is
thought to imply an ignorance of the earth&rsquo;s rotation on
its axis.&nbsp; But really this is so childish that it is
scarcely worth our notice.&nbsp; Is there any one in his senses
who would have expected Joshua to say, &lsquo;Earth, suspend your
rotation round your axis;&rsquo; or to have framed his language
in any other way so as to describe that rotation?&nbsp; And if
Joshua ought to have so expressed himself, why do not astronomers
and other learned men alter their own language now according to
their own science?&nbsp; Or are we to suppose that after all they
know nothing about <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>astronomy, because they speak like ignorant men, and
say, like the rest of us, &lsquo;the sun rises and the sun
sets?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other case, however, is more important, for it is the
object of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis to give an
account of creation, and it is perfectly reasonable therefore to
expect to find it in harmony with geological facts.&nbsp; But
mark.&nbsp; There is a great difference between being in harmony
with geological <i>facts</i>, and in harmony with every
geological <i>theory</i> that is started.&nbsp; We must confine
the argument to what is known, and we have nothing to do with
what people think.&nbsp; True science is a rigid thing, and
relates to facts, not opinions.&nbsp; When, <i>e.g.</i>, people
tell us that there could not be light before the sun, they are
thoroughly unscientific in so saying, for they know nothing of
the kind.&nbsp; There is a vast amount of light at <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>this present
time quite independent of the sun, and the idea that there could
be none before it is nothing more than an unscientific
conjecture.&nbsp; No! we must keep rigidly to facts, to facts
really established by trustworthy evidence; and, keeping
stedfastly to such facts, I have not the least shadow of anxiety
respecting geological discovery.&nbsp; On the contrary, I believe
that the first chapter of Genesis will furnish us, and is even
already furnishing us, with one of the grandest arguments ever
yet produced for the divine inspiration of the book of
Scripture.&nbsp; I cannot but think that that first chapter is
placed in the forefront of the book in order to present us, at
the outset of the whole, with an unanswerable evidence of the
divinity of its origin.</p>
<p>For what is the present position of geology?&nbsp; In the
first place, it is a very young science, one of scarcely more
than <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>fifty
years&rsquo; growth.&nbsp; The most profound geologists are most
convinced how much there is still to be learned, and they are
learning more every day.&nbsp; No really wise man therefore would
give up the inspiration of Scripture in deference to these
present conclusions, even if those conclusions should at first
sight seem to be opposed to the inspired word.</p>
<p>But they are not opposed to it.&nbsp; There may be a
difference of opinion among Christian men as to which is the
right principle of harmony, but there is no difficulty in
harmonizing all geological facts with the plain, literal,
straightforward, honest interpretation of every sentence of the
sacred record.&nbsp; Nay more!&nbsp; There is one remarkable
point of harmony clearly established, viz., this, that in its
great outlines the order of events recorded in the book of
Scripture is the same as the order <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as exhibited in the record of the
rocks.&nbsp; Moses describes a certain order in creation.&nbsp;
Three thousand years after Moses, learned men began to
investigate the earth&rsquo;s crust, and in the rocks which form
that crust, they have discovered the outlines of a certain
order.&nbsp; They have come to the conclusion that certain great
events must have succeeded each other in the creation of the
world.&nbsp; Here therefore you have two records, one from the
rocks, and one from Moses: one only just now discovered, and one
given more than three thousand years ago.&nbsp; But place them
side by side.&nbsp; Do not be afraid of comparing them, for truth
is never afraid of investigation.&nbsp; But in comparing them
what do we find?&nbsp; That the order in the rocks in all its
broad features corresponds step by step with the order in the
Mosaic record; and though there are still some minor
difficulties, still in the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>great, grand, broad facts there is a
magnificent harmony.&nbsp; But whence did Moses learn that
order?&nbsp; The events must have taken place millions and
millions of years before ever man trod this earth.&nbsp; There
were no geologists in his day to teach him.&nbsp; How then could
he have known the order of events which took place ages before
man&rsquo;s being?&nbsp; There is only one answer to be given,
and that is, that he must have been taught it by God
Himself.&nbsp; Thus we may thank our modern geologists, as many
of them delight in believing, for having in these days of
infidelity dug out from the bowels of the earth a fresh and noble
proof, which had lain buried there for centuries, that the first
chapter of the Book of Genesis was given to Moses by inspiration
of God.</p>
<p>But we may go further still with reference to science, and
remark that there are <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>many expressions in Scripture
remarkably in harmony with it, and which almost appear to
indicate a mind far in advance of the knowledge of the day.&nbsp;
Take, <i>e.g.</i>, the distinction drawn by Moses between rain
and dew in Deut. xxxii. 2, &lsquo;My doctrine shall drop as the
rain, and my speech shall distil as the dew.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or the
language of Job respecting the weight of the atmosphere, a
scientific truth unknown till the days of Galileo: &lsquo;To make
the weight for the winds.&rsquo; (Job, xxviii. 25.)&nbsp; Many
similar passages might be quoted, but these are sufficient to
show that, although it was not the purpose of the book to teach
science, there lay hidden within the book the germs of the truest
science, waiting there unobserved till scientific men should
discover the facts, and so by their science bring to light a
fresh evidence of the divine inspiration of the book.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>3.&nbsp; It is alleged that the sacred writers differed
in some instances from secular historians.&nbsp; The favourite
instances adduced are the date of the governments of Cyrenius in
Syria, and that of Lysanius at Abylene.&nbsp; The one is placed
by Josephus about eleven years after the birth of our Lord, and
the other about the same distance of time before the commencement
of John the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp; It is a real pleasure
to find men fixing on such minute points, and to see them obliged
to leave unassailed the vast amount of accumulated evidence to
the accurate fidelity of the sacred records.&nbsp; I confess that
the simple fact of their fastening on such points proves very
clearly to my own mind that they have nothing very substantial on
which to fasten.&nbsp; Suggestions have been thrown out, which,
if true, may meet the difficulty; but with our limited

57</span>after an interval of one thousand eight hundred years,
it is impossible to be sure that they are correct.&nbsp; But
suppose there is a difference.&nbsp; Suppose the chronology of
Josephus is at variance with that of St. Luke.&nbsp; Suppose that
one or the other is in error.&nbsp; Is it impossible, I ask, that
Josephus may be wrong?&nbsp; Is he infallible?&nbsp; Are his
writings guaranteed from error?&nbsp; And why should the
Christian tamely surrender the point, and quietly submit to the
conclusion that St. Luke is wrong and Josephus right?&nbsp; I
protest against such a surrender, and, till there is clearer
evidence than we have obtained at present, I shall venture to
believe that Josephus is mistaken if in anything he really
differs from the inspired word.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; But I have left to the last that which to many minds
is the greatest difficulty.&nbsp; I mean the variations, or as
some would <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>call them, the apparent discrepancies, between the
sacred writers themselves.</p>
<p>Now I have no wish to deny the existence of such variations,
though I dislike the term &lsquo;discrepancies,&rsquo; for I do
not believe there is discrepancy.&nbsp; And in dealing with this
difficulty, there are, I conceive, three principles to be kept
clearly in mind.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The narratives are very short and fragmentary in
their character.&nbsp; They never attempt to record the
whole.&nbsp; Hence one gives one fragment, and another a second,
and these fragments are often like the fossil bones of a
skeleton.&nbsp; Ignorant men, which we all are, cannot fit them
together; but we must not on that account assert them to be
contradictory; for when the structure of the whole is once
discovered, they will all fit into their proper places, and all
the scattered fragments be combined in perfect symmetry.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>2.&nbsp; There is the widest possible distinction
between variation and contradiction.&nbsp; If two writers give an
account of the same event, they will each regard it from their
own point of view, and describe it as it impressed
themselves.&nbsp; Hence one will bring into prominence certain
facts which are altogether omitted by another.&nbsp; But such a
variation is totally different from contradiction.&nbsp; An
excellent illustration of this is found in the case of the
inscription over the cross, a case which Dean Alford considers
decisive against verbal inspiration.&nbsp; Now I am quite ready
to admit that, if there were contradiction, it would be
decisive.&nbsp; But I deny that there is any contradiction
whatever.&nbsp; There is variation, but nothing more.&nbsp; All
agree in the emphatic point&mdash;&rsquo;The king of the
Jews,&rsquo; and the only difference is that some give <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>in addition a
few more words than others.&nbsp; But these added words are not
at variance with each other.&nbsp; On the contrary, they all
combine in one sentence, which probably formed the real
inscription.&nbsp; That sentence is
&Omicron;&#8020;&tau;&#8057;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&nu;
&#7992;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &#8004;
&Nu;&alpha;&zeta;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&#8055;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#8004;
&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8058;&sigmaf;
&tau;&omega;&nu;
&#7992;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&alpha;&#8055;&omega;&nu;.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is Jesus of Nazareth the king of the
Jews.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, supposing that to have been the real
sentence, so that each of the evangelists omitted some of the
explanatory words, while all preserved, &lsquo;The king of the
Jews,&rsquo; which was the real point of the inscription, there
was no discrepancy or contradiction in such omissions, nor
anything to affect our full and complete reliance in the verbal
accuracy of all the four evangelists.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is also most important for us to remember that
such variations are essential to the value of a fourfold
testimony.&nbsp; If <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>God had seen fit to impart His truth by direct
communication only, then I freely grant that I should have
expected a <i>verbatim</i> agreement in the narratives.&nbsp; But
in that case there would have been no employment of the human
element.&nbsp; Nay more; if the life of our Lord had been so
reported, the evidence would have become single, instead of
fourfold.&nbsp; Even, as it is, it has been argued that the
resemblance is so accurate as to show that the evangelists copied
from one common tradition, and must not be regarded as
independent witnesses.&nbsp; The variation therefore becomes
almost as important to us as the agreement, and, instead of
shaking our convictions, confirms them.&nbsp; That blessed
Redeemer is the corner-stone of our hopes, and therefore, instead
of two witnesses, which under the law were sufficient, He has <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>given us two
pair of witnesses.&nbsp; And in the inspiration of their words He
has given so much scope to the human element that there are all
the variations inseparable from independent testimony; while, on
the other hand, He has so guided, directed, and controlled the
whole, that, notwithstanding all the cavils of sceptics, there is
no real contradiction in their statements.&nbsp; There is
variation enough to prove the independence of their evidence,
while there is such a depth in their complete agreement, as can
only be explained by the fact that they were taught by
God&rsquo;s Spirit to convey to us infallible truth.</p>
<p>Other objections have, I know, been urged; but all, I firmly
believe, may be fully and fairly met by the principle that it has
pleased God in His own wisdom to combine in the one book the
divine and <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>human element.&nbsp; In some cases the mind of the man
may be more conspicuous than the mind of the Spirit, while in
others the mind of the Spirit seems completely to overrule the
mind of the author who wrote the words.&nbsp; In some passages
the thoughts are so far within man&rsquo;s compass that no
inspiration appears to be necessary, while in others they dive so
deep into hidden mysteries that they far outstep the utmost range
of the human intellect.&nbsp; Thus God has given us a record of
what man has felt, as well as a statement of His own hidden
will.&nbsp; He has given it through the medium of minds of the
same nature as our own; but by His own mysterious power He has
given their writings such a divine authority that they claim our
unwavering trust; so that, notwithstanding the cavils of
infidels, and the sneers of those who <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>despise us as bibliolaters, we
heartily thank God for our Bibles, and receive as divine all that
God has taught in them, believing without reserve the statement
of St. Peter, that &lsquo;Holy men of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
